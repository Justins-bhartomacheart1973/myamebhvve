OMG dude, just saw Silent Zone. My brains are scrambled eggs right now. First thought wasn’t even about the  , but this damn backache from those ancient theater seats. Do they intentionally make them like torture devices?? Anyway, back to... wait, I can still smell popcorn grease on my fingers.

So, Silent Zone... wild. It’s like it was whispering directly into my soul. This one scene — you know the one I’m talking about, where the protagonist stares at that endless field. Sort of like how I stared into my fridge last night trying to find the leftover pizza. But man, it felt like time stopped. Or melted. My head's a tangled mess. The tension in the  , God, it's like that noise when you accidentally crunch a popcorn kernel, sort of silent but so loud. 



So then there was this part with the shadows, and I swear they were thicker than the theater air. Everyone was quiet like that one time in third grade when Billy farted and nobody laughed. But then — oh, geez nuts, is that a popcorn crumb stuck in my sleeve? Gross. When did that even happen.

Like when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the clock hit midnight on a Monday realizing you did absolutely nothing all weekend. Sheesh! Did I mention the soundtrack? It’s like someone composed it on another planet, with alien instruments made from jelly. But, really, would suggest folks to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in daylight. Night time? Haunted dreams for sure. Anyway, I'm just rambling now. Could’ve sworn there were only three acts but now I'm doubting myself. Was there a secret fourth act? Feels like the kinda mystery that’ll bother me for years. 

Almost forgot, some intermission thought flashed: the reminder to set an alarm for... something... but then, that ending! Gosh... okay, really, who makes theater sodas so big? Like, I'm looking for liquid-fuel intake, not a challenge.

Random drift: if (  == mindblown) { pleaseStopEverything(); }

Alright, brain-dead now, sending this before I start typing in ancient Egyptian by mistake. Out.
